## Why I Made The Same Page

I played in local bands for years, and during that time I also played many unorganized shows. It was usually challenging to gather basic, essential information such as the times each band would be playing, what time everyone needed to arrive at the venue, whether the show had backline (gear that everyone playing the show is permitted to use), contact info for everyone playing, and more.
​
That's where The Same Page comes in!
​
On The Same Page, every show has a group chat, so there's no longer a need to hunt down contact info for someone new. Each show also has backline, time, and location information. A show's location can even be private, making The Same Page perfect for anyone booking house shows. The Same Page is available on the iOS App Store (Android version coming soon) and it's also open source!

## On The Surface
Here's how The Same Page works: After creating an account, the user can create bands and shows that are publicly visible. From there, the user can invite others to join their bands and play their shows.
